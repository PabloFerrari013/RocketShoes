# RocketShoes

## ðŸ¤” About the project
This project is a challenge from Rocketseat's Ignite course, to train on what I've learned so far with ReactJS

The main objective of this application is to create a shopping cart hook, where I developed the following features:

- Add a new product to the cart;
- Remove a product from the cart;
- Change the quantity of a product in the cart;
- Calculation of sub-total and total cart prices;
- Stock validation;
- Display of error messages;
- Between others.
